        "1.  **Garbage Collection:** While Python's garbage collector (GC) helps manage memory by removing unused objects, it doesn't eliminate all issues. Circular references can cause memory leaks if the garbage collector doesn't handle them properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   **Fragmentation:** Memory fragmentation can occur when there's a lot of allocation and deallocation of memory. This can lead to inefficient use of memory and potentially cause the program to use more memory than necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   **Reference Counting:** Python uses reference counting for memory management, where each object has a reference count that tracks the number of references to it. This can cause problems if circular references exist, as they won't be collected by the garbage collector, leading to memory leaks.\n",
        "4.  ** Memory Overhead:** Python objects often have additional memory overhead due to internal bookkeeping. This can lead to higher memory usage compared to languages with more explicit memory management.\n",

        "3.  **Efficiency:** For computational tasks that can be parallelized, multithreading can significantly reduce processing time. By dividing a task into smaller sub-tasks that can run concurrently, you can leverage multiple CPU cores to work on these tasks simultaneously.\n",
        "4.   **Resource Utilization:** Multithreading can help you better utilize the system's resources. For example, while one thread waits for a file to download, another thread can process already downloaded data, ensuring that CPU and I/O resources are used more effectively.\n",
